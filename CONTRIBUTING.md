# Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-72 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

1.  Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.), or I will do it for you
2.  If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
3.  Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
4.  Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
5.  Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/outbred/SimpleSamSettings/issues) first, before filing an issue.
6.  Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do
